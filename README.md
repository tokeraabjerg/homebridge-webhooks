# homebridge-webhooks

HomeBridge-webhooks does exactly what it sounds like, it enables users to interact with HomeBrdige accessories through a webhook. 

For example one could, with only a link, turn on their lights.

I made this project because I wanted to create a custom website to control my lights, this was the easiest way to do that, added bonus how versaitile is it.

Be aware - I never properly tested this or actually published it. I was using it for a while, now I don't use HomeBridge anymore.
